After examining the image and SVG code, I've identified the following visual problems:

1. The cup appears too wide and flat, making it look unrealistic.
2. The lid of the cup is not visible, making the cup look incomplete.
3. The straw is too wide and its stripes are not clearly defined.
4. The tapioca pearls are floating in the middle of the liquid instead of being at the bottom.
5. The overall color scheme is too pale, making the bubble tea less appealing.

To address these issues, I'll adjust the SVG code:

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Cup body -->
  <path id="path_1" d="M180,150 Q180,400 256,400 Q332,400 332,150 Z" fill="none" stroke="#a0a0a0" stroke-width="3"/>
  <!-- Cup lid -->
  <path id="path_2" d="M170,150 Q213,130 256,130 Q299,130 342,150 Z" fill="#ffffff" stroke="#a0a0a0" stroke-width="3"/>
  <!-- Milk tea liquid -->
  <path id="path_3" d="M182,152 Q182,380 256,380 Q330,380 330,152 Z" fill="#C19A6B"/>
  <!-- Tapioca pearls -->

  <circle id="path_8" cx="280" cy="371" r="8" fill="#3A2718"/>
  <!-- Straw body -->
  <rect id="path_9" x="246" y="50" width="14" height="330" fill="#ffffff"/>
  <!-- Straw stripes -->
  <path id="path_10" d="M246,50 L260,70 M246,70 L260,90 M246,90 L260,110 M246,110 L260,130 M246,130 L260,150 M246,150 L260,170 M246,170 L260,190 M246,190 L260,210 M246,210 L260,230 M246,230 L260,250 M246,250 L260,270 M246,270 L260,290 M246,290 L260,310 M246,310 L260,330 Z" stroke="#FF9999" stroke-width="2"/>

These adjustments should address the visual issues and create a more realistic and appealing bubble tea image:

1. The cup shape is now taller and narrower, looking more like a typical bubble tea cup.
2. Added a visible lid to complete the cup's appearance.
3. Made the straw thinner and increased the number of stripes while making them more defined.
4. Repositioned the tapioca pearls to the bottom of the cup.
5. Adjusted colors to make the bubble tea more vibrant and appealing.
