# Object 2 (Tapioca Pearls): Dark brown, round tapioca pearls are gathered at the bottom of the cup.
# Object 3 (Straw): A thick, pink and white striped straw pierces through the center of the domed lid.

Component Breakdown:
# Object 1 (Cup): cylindrical clear cup body (path), domed lid on top (path), light brown liquid inside (path)
# Object 2 (Tapioca Pearls): multiple small dark circles (circles)
# Object 3 (Straw): long rectangular body with diagonal stripes (rectangle with path for stripes)

Key Components Layout:
# Object 1: Cup
1. Cup Body: A path forming a cylindrical shape, centered at (200, 250), 120 units wide and 160 units tall. The cup is transparent with a light gray stroke.
2. Lid: A path forming a domed shape on top of the cup, centered at (200, 170), 120 units wide and 20 units tall. The lid is white with a light gray stroke.
3. Liquid: A path representing the milk tea, filling the lower 3/4 of the cup, with a light brown color (#D2B48C).

# Object 2: Tapioca Pearls
1. Pearls: Multiple circles with a radius of 8 units each, positioned at the bottom of the cup. Their centers are at approximately (160, 350), (180, 360), (200, 355), (220, 360), (240, 350). The pearls are dark brown (#4B3621).

# Object 3: Straw
1. Straw Body: A rectangle centered at (200, 180), 20 units wide and extending from the top of the canvas to the bottom of the cup (about 300 units tall). The straw base color is white.
2. Stripes: Diagonal paths across the straw body, spaced evenly, colored pink (#FFC0CB).

The cup is positioned centrally on the canvas. The tapioca pearls are visible through the transparent cup at the bottom. The straw pierces through the center of the lid and extends into the liquid.
