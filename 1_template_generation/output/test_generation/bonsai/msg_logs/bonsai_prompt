Scene Description:
"A miniature bonsai tree with twisted branches and small green leaves sits in a rustic earthenware pot. The tree's gnarled trunk rises from a bed of dark soil."

Object Detail:
# Object 1 (Bonsai Tree): The bonsai tree has a brown, gnarled trunk with several twisted branches. Its foliage consists of small, vibrant green leaves clustered at the ends of the branches. The tree's overall shape is asymmetrical and artistic.
# Object 2 (Pot): The pot is a wide, shallow earthenware container with a reddish-brown color. It has a slightly textured surface and a subtle lip around the top edge.
# Object 3 (Soil): Dark brown soil fills the pot, covering the tree's roots and providing a base for the bonsai.

Component Breakdown:
# Object 1 (Bonsai Tree): Brown gnarled trunk (path), twisted branches (paths), clusters of small green leaves (multiple small circles or ellipses), exposed roots at the base (polylines)
# Object 2 (Pot): Wide, shallow circular base (ellipse), textured surface (multiple small circles or lines), lip around the top edge (path)
# Object 3 (Soil): Dark brown irregular surface (path)

Key Components Layout:
# Object 1: Bonsai Tree
1. Trunk: A path starting from (250, 300) and extending upwards to (250, 150), with curves and bends to represent the gnarled structure.
2. Branches: Multiple paths extending from the trunk, reaching out in various directions. For example, one branch from (250, 200) to (200, 150), another from (250, 180) to (300, 120).
3. Leaves: Clusters of small circles or ellipses (radius 2-3 units) positioned at the ends of the branches. For instance, a cluster centered at (195, 145) and another at (305, 115).
4. Roots: Polylines starting from the base of the trunk at (250, 300) and extending slightly above the soil line, for example, to points (240, 295) and (260, 295).

# Object 2: Pot
1. Base: An ellipse centered at (250, 350) with rx=100 and ry=50, representing the wide, shallow pot.
2. Texture: Multiple small circles (radius 1-2 units) or short lines scattered across the pot's surface to suggest texture.
3. Lip: A path tracing the top edge of the pot, slightly raised above the main ellipse, from (150, 345) to (350, 345).

# Object 3: Soil
1. Surface: A path starting at (155, 340), curving slightly to represent the soil surface, and ending at (345, 340).

The bonsai tree is positioned centrally in the pot, with its trunk rising from the soil. The pot is placed at the bottom of the canvas, providing a stable base for the entire composition. The tree's asymmetrical form extends towards the top and sides of the canvas, creating a balanced yet dynamic visual arrangement.
