Scene Description:
"A vibrant pink flamingo stands tall, gracefully walking across a shallow lagoon. Its long, slender legs are partially submerged in clear, rippling water."

Object Detail:
# Object 1 (Flamingo): The flamingo has a bright pink body with a long, curved neck. Its head is small and rounded, featuring a large, downward-curved beak. The flamingo's legs are incredibly long and thin, with one leg raised mid-stride. Its wings are folded against its body, and its tail feathers are short and rounded.
# Object 2 (Water): The water is clear and shallow, with gentle ripples surrounding the flamingo's legs.

Component Breakdown:
# Object 1 (Flamingo): oval-shaped body (ellipse), long curved neck (path), small rounded head (circle), large curved beak (path), two long thin legs (lines), webbed feet (polygon), folded wings (path), short rounded tail (path), small eye (circle)
# Object 2 (Water): horizontal surface (rectangle), ripples around legs (paths)

Key Components Layout:
# Object 1: Flamingo
1. Body: An ellipse centered at (256, 200), 120 units wide and 80 units high. The body is bright pink (#FF69B4).
2. Neck: A curved path starting from the top of the body (256, 160) and ending at the head position (296, 100). The neck is the same pink as the body.
3. Head: A small circle with a radius of 15 units, centered at (296, 100). The head is pink.
4. Beak: A curved path starting from the head (311, 100), curving downward and ending at (331, 110). The beak is dark pink (#FF1493).
5. Legs: Two thin lines, one straight and one slightly bent. The straight leg starts at (276, 240) and ends at (286, 380). The bent leg starts at (236, 240), has a midpoint at (226, 300), and ends at (216, 380). Both legs are light pink (#FFC0CB).
6. Feet: Two small polygons at the bottom of each leg, centered at (286, 385) and (216, 385), representing webbed feet. The feet are light pink.
7. Wings: A curved path along the side of the body, from (196, 180) to (316, 220), suggesting folded wings.
8. Tail: A short, rounded path at the rear of the body, centered at (196, 200).
9. Eye: A tiny black circle with a radius of 3 units, placed at (301, 95) on the head.

# Object 2: Water
1. Surface: A rectangle spanning the entire width of the canvas (512 units), positioned at the bottom, 100 units tall. The water is light blue (#ADD8E6).
2. Ripples: Several curved paths around the flamingo's legs, centered at (286, 380) and (216, 380), to suggest water disturbance. The ripples are slightly darker blue (#87CEEB).
