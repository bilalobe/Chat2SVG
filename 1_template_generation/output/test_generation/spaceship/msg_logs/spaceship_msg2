After examining the image and SVG code, I've identified the following visual problems:

1. The spaceship body is too elongated and thin, making it look unrealistic.
2. The wings are not clearly visible or distinguishable from the body.
3. The flames from the thrusters appear as a thin line rather than a flame-like shape.
4. The nose cone is not clearly visible or distinct from the body.
5. The cockpit window is positioned too far back on the spaceship.
6. The crescent moon looks more like a full circle or oval than a crescent shape.

To address these issues, I'll make the following adjustments to the SVG code:

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Night sky background -->
  <rect id="path_1" x="0" y="0" width="512" height="512" fill="#000033"/>
  
  <!-- Stars -->
  <circle id="path_2" cx="50" cy="50" r="2" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <circle id="path_3" cx="100" cy="100" r="1" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <circle id="path_4" cx="150" cy="75" r="2" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <circle id="path_5" cx="200" cy="150" r="1" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <circle id="path_6" cx="300" cy="50" r="2" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <circle id="path_7" cx="350" cy="100" r="1" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <circle id="path_8" cx="400" cy="75" r="2" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <circle id="path_9" cx="450" cy="125" r="1" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  
  <!-- Crescent moon -->
  <path id="path_10" d="M470,50 Q490,70 470,90 Q460,70 470,50 Z" fill="#D3D3D3"/>
  
  <!-- Spaceship body -->
  <ellipse id="path_11" cx="256" cy="256" rx="100" ry="40" fill="#C0C0C0"/>
  
  <!-- Spaceship nose cone -->
  <polygon id="path_12" points="356,256 386,246 386,266" fill="#A9A9A9"/>
  
  <!-- Spaceship left wing -->
  <polygon id="path_13" points="206,256 156,286 186,256" fill="#A9A9A9"/>
  
  <!-- Spaceship right wing -->
  <polygon id="path_14" points="306,256 356,286 326,256" fill="#A9A9A9"/>
  
  <!-- Spaceship flames -->
  <path id="path_15" d="M156,256 Q126,246 116,256 Q126,266 156,256 Z" fill="#1E90FF"/>
  
  <!-- Spaceship cockpit window -->
  <circle id="path_16" cx="306" cy="256" r="15" fill="#87CEEB"/>
</svg>
```

These adjustments address the visual issues:

1. The spaceship body is now wider and more proportionate (path_11).
2. The wings have been adjusted to be more visible and distinct from the body (path_13 and path_14).
3. The flames are now represented by a filled path element for a more flame-like appearance (path_15).
4. The nose cone has been slightly enlarged to be more distinct (path_12).
5. The cockpit window has been moved forward and enlarged for better visibility (path_16).
6. The crescent moon shape has been refined to look more crescent-like (path_10).

These changes should result in a more visually coherent and realistic representation of the spaceship flying in the night sky.
