Scene Description:
"A sleek silver spaceship soars through the dark night sky, illuminated by twinkling stars and a distant crescent moon."

Object Detail:
# Object 1 (Spaceship): The spaceship has a elongated silver body with a pointed nose cone. Two swept-back wings extend from its sides, and blue flames emit from its rear thrusters. A small cockpit window is visible near the front.
# Object 2 (Stars): Multiple small, bright white stars are scattered across the night sky.
# Object 3 (Moon): A thin crescent moon shines in the distance, its silvery surface partially illuminated.

Component Breakdown:
# Object 1 (Spaceship): elongated silver body (ellipse), pointed nose cone (triangle), two swept-back wings (polygons), blue flames from thrusters (polyline), cockpit window (circle)
# Object 2 (Stars): multiple small bright points (circles)
# Object 3 (Moon): thin crescent shape (path)

Key Components Layout:
# Object 1: Spaceship
1. Body: An ellipse centered at (256, 256), 200 units wide and 60 units high. The body is silver (#C0C0C0).
2. Nose Cone: A triangle with points at (356, 256), (386, 246), and (386, 266) to form the pointed front.
3. Wings: Two polygons, one on each side of the body. Left wing points: (206, 256), (156, 296), (186, 256). Right wing points: (306, 256), (356, 296), (326, 256).
4. Flames: A polyline starting from (156, 256) with points at (126, 246), (116, 256), (126, 266) to represent the blue (#1E90FF) exhaust.
5. Cockpit Window: A small circle with a radius of 10 units, centered at (336, 256) on the body.

# Object 2: Stars
1. Multiple circles with radii of 1-2 units, scattered across the canvas. Positions: (50, 50), (100, 100), (150, 75), (200, 150), (300, 50), (350, 100), (400, 75), (450, 125). The stars are white (#FFFFFF).

# Object 3: Moon
1. A path starting at (450, 50) curving to (470, 70) and back to (450, 90) to form a thin crescent shape. The moon is light grey (#D3D3D3).
